Docker is a set of tools to deliver software in containers.\\n2. Containers are packages of software.\\nThe above image illustrates how containers include the application and its dependencies.

Sounds simple, right? To illustrate the potential benefits let\\'s\\ntalk about different scenarios.\\nScenario 1: Works on my machine\\nLet\\'s first take a closer look into what happens in web development without containers following\\nthe chain above starting from \"Plan\".\\nFirst you plan an application. Then your team of 1-n developers create the software. It works on\\nyour computer. It may even go through a testing pipeline working perfectly. You send it to the\\nserver and...\\n...it does not work.\\nThis is known as the \"works on my machine\" problem. The only way to solve this is by finding\\nout what in tarnation the developer had installed on their machine that made the application\\nwork.\\nContainers solve this problem by allowing the developer to personally run the application inside\\na container, which then includes all of the dependencies required for the app to work.\\nYou may still occasionally hear about \"works in my container\" issues - these are often just\\nusage errors.\\nScenario 2: Isolated environments\\nYou have 5 different Python applications. You need to deploy them to a server that already has an\\napplication requiring Python 2.7 and of course none of your applications are 2.7. What do you\\ndo?\\nSince containers package the software with all of its dependencies, you package the existing app\\nand all 5 new ones with their respective Python versions and that\\'s it.\\nI can only imagine the disaster that would result if you try to run them side by side on the same\\nmachine without isolating the environments. It sounds more like a time bomb. Sometimes\\ndifferent parts of a system may change over time, possibly leading to the application not\\nworking. These changes may be anything from an operating system update to changes in\\ndependencies.\\nScenario 3: Development\\n2/21/25, 11:28 AM Definitions and basic concepts | DevOps with Docker\\nhttps://devopswithdocker.com/part-1/section-1 3/13'),\n",

With one\\ncommand you get an isolated application, like Postgres or Mongo, running in your machine.\\nScenario 4: Scaling\\nStarting and stopping a Docker container has little overhead. But when you run your own Netflix\\nor Facebook, you want to meet the changing demand. With some advanced tooling that we will\\nlearn about in parts 2 and 3, we can spin up multiple containers instantly and load balance traffic\\nbetween them.\\nContainer orchestration will be discussed in parts 2 and 3. But the simplest example: what\\nhappens when one application dies? The orchestration system notices it, splits traffic between the\\nworking replicas, and spins up a new container to replace the dead one.\\nVirtual machines\\nIsn't there already a solution for this? Virtual Machines are not the same as Containers - they\\nsolve different problems. We will not be looking into Virtual Machines in this course.

A basic mistake is to confuse images and containers.\\nCooking metaphor:\\nThink of a container as a ready-to-eat meal that you can simply heat up and consume. An image,\\non the other hand, is the recipe or ingredients for that meal.\\nSo just like how you need a recipe and ingredients to make a meal, you need an image and a\\ncontainer runtime (Docker engine) to create a container. The image provides all the necessary\\ninstructions and dependencies for the container to run, just like a recipe provides the steps and\\ningredients to make a meal.\\nIn short, an image is like a blueprint or template, while a container is an instance of that blueprint\\nor template.\\nImage\\nA Docker image is a file. An image never changes; you can not edit an existing file. Creating a\\nnew image happens by starting from a base image and adding new layers to it. We will talk\\nabout layers later, but you should think of images as immutable, they can not be changed after\\nthey are created.\\nList all your images with docker image ls\\n$ docker image ls\\n  REPOSITORY      TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE\\n  hello-world     latest   d1165f221234   9 days ago      13.3kB\\n2/21/25, 11:28 AM Definitions and basic concepts | DevOps with Docker\\nhttps://devopswithdocker.com/part-1/section-1 7/13\"),\n",

      "Answer: According to the text, DevOps is a development methodology aimed at bridging the gap between Development and Operations, emphasizing communication and collaboration, continuous integration, quality assurance and delivery with automated deployment utilizing a set of development practices.  A simpler definition is that the release, configuring, and monitoring of software is in the hands of the developers.\n",

      "Answer: Based on the provided text, a container is a package of software that includes the application and its dependencies.  The benefits of using containers include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Solving the \"works on my machine\" problem:** Containers ensure consistent environments, preventing discrepancies between development and production environments.\n",
      "* **Creating isolated environments:**  Containers allow multiple applications with different dependencies (e.g., different Python versions) to run concurrently without interfering with each other.\n",
      "* **Simplifying development:** Containers streamline the process of setting up and managing development databases and other dependencies.\n",
      "* **Enabling scaling:** Containers can be easily started and stopped, enabling efficient scaling to meet changing demands and facilitating automated recovery from application failures.\n",
      "Question: How to run containers on our machines?\n",

Then, you can run a command such as  `docker container run hello-world` (or the shorter `docker run hello-world`).  The text also notes that because Docker uses Linux kernels, running it on Mac and Windows requires additional steps and solutions specific to those operating systems.\n",
